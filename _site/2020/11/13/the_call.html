<meta name="description" content="And He summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits; and He instructed them that they were to take nothing for their journey, except a mere staff — no bread, no bag, no money in their belt — but to wear sandals; and He added, “Do not wear two tunics.” -Mark 6:7-9 As fathers, we have a calling to lead our families, and we have been equipped with the tools we need to do the job. In the process of sending the apostles out, Jesus gave them some things, but not other things, which raises the question, why? Jesus clearly gives them three things, a partner, authority and instructions. He does not give them anything extra that has to be carried, kept up with or maintained. If you remember dragging a diaper bag around, or are still in that phase, you can appreciate Jesus’s instructions. Looking at this list, many of you recognize your spouse as your partner, but some of you see that you don’t have a partner and this is fine too, because you have the other things. We have the authority and instruction of the Lord. God has entrusted us to share him with our children and has given us the tools to teach and guide them. Additionally, as our children grow, the leadership and instruction they need from us will change, but the things we need on the journey will be provided. It’s hard to accept the mission we have as fathers and many times, we don’t know what we’re doing or if we’re doing it right, but those are the times to trust in the one that called you to be a father and move forward in faith." />

As fathers, we have a calling to lead our families, and we have been equipped with the tools we need to do the job. In the process of sending the apostles out, Jesus gave them some things, but not other things, which raises the question, why? Jesus clearly gives them three things, a partner, authority and instructions. He does not give them anything extra that has to be carried, kept up with or maintained. If you remember dragging a diaper bag around, or are still in that phase, you can appreciate Jesus’s instructions.
