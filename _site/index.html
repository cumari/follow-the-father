  <blockquote>
  Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the Jordan, coming to John to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I have the need to be baptized by You, and yet You are coming to me?” But Jesus, answering, said to him, “Allow it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed Him. After He was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and settling on Him, and behold, a voice from the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
  <br/>-Matthew 3:13-17
</blockquote>
<p>
  Jesus was God in human form walking with us on Earth, yet he made a point of humbling himself to be baptized by John the Baptist. Both John and Jesus acknowledge that their roles appear backwards, but as Jesus states, it is a step that must be fulfilled. Through His obedience, Jesus sets the example for all of us that follow in His footsteps. Baptism does not actually cleanse our spirit, but is a symbolic act that shares the good news of what Jesus did through His death and resurrection to make us clean.

  As fathers, we expect our children to follow our direction. While they may not see the logic of the rules and instruction we provide, we have a different perspective brought on by age and hopefully some wisdom. In the same way, our Heavenly Father attempts to gently guide us, and when we get into a stubborn phase, guides a little more forcefully or lets us make our mistakes. Remember, you still love your children when they are at their most difficult and your Heavenly Father is still there when you are done trying your own way.

  God took the time to express pride in His Son's obedience. Look for opportunities to express pride in the members of your family throughout the day.
