<h2>The Cost of Sin</h2>
<p>
  Like many things in the church, salvation is a simple concept that has been overly complicated by holy men sitting in holy buildings thinking holy thoughts. As the apostle Paul states above, salvation is a gift from God that we can't earn. We just have to accept it through faith. This is encouraging, because it means that we don't have to worry about doing or saying things exactly right in order to be saved. Answering the three questions below will let you know if you are ready.
