<blockquote>
  For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
  <br/>-Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>
<h2>Accepting The Gift</h2>
<p>
  Like many things in the church, salvation is a simple concept that has been overly complicated by holy men sitting in holy buildings thinking holy thoughts. As the apostle Paul states above, salvation is a gift from God that we can't earn. We just have to accept it through faith. This is encouraging, because it means that we don't have to worry about doing or saying things exactly right in order to be saved. Let's take a look at the example Jesus gave us while on the cross.
</p>
<blockquote>
  One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!” But the other responded, and rebuking him, said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our crimes; but this man has done nothing wrong.” And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!” And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”
  <br/>-Luke 23:39-43
</blockquote>
<p>
	The first thing we see is the difference between the two criminals. One criminal is looking for a way to gain physical salvation for himmself. The second criminal recognizes the innocense of Jesus and the presence of God in Him. He comes to Jesus in humility knowing that he deserves to be punished for his life of sin, but trusting that Jesus can heal his guilt.

  While we aren't facing death sentences at the hands of the government, every one of us is guilty of putting our wants ahead of God's and sinning against Him. Fortunatly, accepting God's gift of forgivness and entering a relationship with Him is easy.

<ol>
	<li>Recognize that Jesus was both God and man</li>
	<li>Jesus lived a perfect life, died on a cross to take the punishment for your sins, was buried and rose from the dead</li>
	<li>Confess that you are a sinner and don't deserve forgivness, but that doesn't matter, because God is giving you forgivness anyway.</li>
</ol>
