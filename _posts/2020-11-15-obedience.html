<blockquote>
  In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon Him; and a voice came from the heavens: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”
  <br/>-Mark 1:9-11

<p>
  Jesus was God in human form walking with us on Earth, yet he made a point of humbling himself to be baptized by John the Baptist. Both John and Jesus acknowledge that their roles appear backwards, but as Jesus states, it is a step that must be fulfilled. Through His obedience, Jesus sets the example for all of us that follow in His footsteps. Baptism does not actually cleanse our spirit, but is a symbolic act that shares the good news of what Jesus did through His death and resurrection to make us clean.

  As fathers, we expect our children to follow our direction. While they may not see the logic of the rules and instruction we provide, we have a different perspective brought on by age and hopefully some wisdom. In the same way, our Heavenly Father attempts to gently guide us, and when we get into a stubborn phase, guides a little more forcefully or lets us make our mistakes. Remember, you still love your children when they are at their most difficult and your Heavenly Father is still there when you are done trying your own way.

  God took the time to express pride in His Son's obedience. Look for opportunities to express pride in the members of your family throughout the day.
