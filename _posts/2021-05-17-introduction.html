<blockquote>
  For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
  <br/>-Ephesians 2:8-9
</blockquote>
<h2>Accepting The Gift</h2>
<p>
  Like many things in the church, salvation is a simple concept that has been overly complicated by holy men sitting in holy buildings thinking holy thoughts. As the apostle Paul states above, salvation is a gift from God that we can't earn. We just have to accept it through faith. This is encouraging, because it means that we don't have to worry about doing or saying things exactly right in order to be saved. Answering the three questions below will let you know if you are ready.

<ol>
	<li>Are you a sinner?</li>
	<li>Do you believe Jesus died on the cross for your sins?</li>
	<li>Do you accept His forgivness and commit to following Him?</li>
</ol>
