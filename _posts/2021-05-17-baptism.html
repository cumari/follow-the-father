<blockquote>
  Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life.

<h2>What is Baptism?</h2>
<p>
  Once a person chooses to follow Christ, one of the first steps they take is to get baptised. While baptism is not required for salvation, it is a good place to start your growth as a new christian. Baptism is a public example of what happened when you made the decision to follow Jesus.
