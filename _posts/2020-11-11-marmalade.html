<blockquote>
  Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or what person is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? So if you, despite being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! 
  <br/>-Matthew 7:7-11

  My daughter enjoys making her own lunch before school in the morning. Her current favorite is marmalade. While walking by her sandwich, I noticed it had the sparsest layer of marmalade I had ever seen. She had basically made a bread sandwich. I asked her why it was so thin and she explained that if she put her usual amount on the sandwich, she wouldn’t have enough to last the rest of the week. I quickly grabbed the jar and fixed the situation. When she gets to my house in the morning, she will find a brand new jar waiting for her when she is done with the old one.

  There are two important lessons to learn here. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    She didn’t have a spare marmalade, because she never asked for it. She had a full jar of something else, because that was last week’s sandwich of choice.
  </li>
  <li>
    She had what she needed for today and that was enough if she trusted tomorrow to take care of itself.
  </li>
</ol>

  Seeing my daughter trying to handle the situation without bringing her problems to me was frustrating, because she didn’t fully trust me. In the same way, we have a heavenly Father that wants us to bring our troubles to him through prayer and trust him to take care of them. Things may not always work out in the way that we want, but they will work out like they should.
