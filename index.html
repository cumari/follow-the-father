<blockquote>
  The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.
  <br/>-Matthew 13:44

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
	Jesus came down from heaven, took the form of a man and died on a cross to pay the price none of us could pay, so we can enjoy a personal relationship with God. Through that relationship, we learn who God made us to be and our proper place in our homes, churches and communities. 
</p>
<p>
	We will help fellow christians build that relationship through collections of small intentional lessons designed to guide them in building the foundations needed to grow in their faith and knowledge.
