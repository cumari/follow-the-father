<blockquote>
  The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.
  <br/>-Matthew 13:44

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
	Jesus came down from heaven, took the form of a man and died on a cross to pay the price none of us could pay, so we can enjoy a personal relationship with God. Through that relationship, we learn who God made us to be and our proper place in our homes, churches and communities. 
</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>
	Twenty years ago, I knew I was destined for ministry, but I didn't know what form that would take and always found myself pushed in a different direction. At the end of 2020, I dropped everything, quit my job and committed to pursuing ministry full-time in whatever form it took. After almost 6 months of being still, studying and preparing, it is time to move forward. 
</p>
<p>
	During almost 20 years of working various jobs, I have made many friends that are not christians. In fact, most of them are atheist or some other form of anti-christian beliefe. As I spent time getting to know them, I often found a christian background that soured leading them to leave the church and give up on God.
</p>
<p>
	During my 6 months of study, I saw the opposit. I was privlaged to find myself working closely with young men that were making decisions to follow Christ on a regular basis, but I also noticed that these young teenagers didn't alway fully understand what they were signing up for. That's when I made the connection. The young men that passionatly chose to follow Christ needed to be mentored past the big decisions of salvation and baptism into a deeper understanding of who God is, or they will become the next generation of former christians.
</p>
<p>
	The purpose of Follow the Father is to help provide discipleship to christians of all ages and denominations. This website should never replace your church, because gathering with fellow believers is critical for proper growth.
