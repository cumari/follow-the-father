  “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.”
  <br/>
  Ephesians 6:4
 </p>
<p>
  I don’t know how many times I threw that verse in my dad’s face as a kid, but I never caught that second part. Many times, being told what is right is more important than being told what is wrong, because if we focus on doing what is right, the rest will work itself out. Our job as fathers is to guide our children to our heavenly Father through loving discipline and instruction.

  Unfortunately, we get caught up in the things of this world and sometimes forget our calling as fathers. While these failures are hard to accept, the Bible is full of men that failed, but through acknowledging their failure and turning to the grace of God, moved forward in the right direction. This site is meant to help us see our successes and failures and move forward in faith to be the fathers we are meant to be.

The First Step
</h2>
<p>
  It’s hard to introduce your children to someone you don’t know, so if you don’t know God, it’s time you met Him. Everyone of us has made mistakes in our lives, something that we knew was right that we didn’t do or something we knew was wrong that we did anyway. This is called sin and it places a barrier between us and God, but that’s where Jesus comes in. God sent His Son, Jesus, to live the life of perfection that we could not. Jesus died on a cross to remove the sin that separated us and three days later rose from the grave. Removing that barrier between you and God is as easy as confessing that you have sinned and accepting the gift of forgiveness that Jesus provides. At that point, you have a new heavenly Father, and God lives inside of you through the Holy Spirit.

  If you decided to take this step, it’s time to find a church where you can learn and grow. You will also want to get baptized which is a way to publicly share your new life with others and is the first step of obedience.
